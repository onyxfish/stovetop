h1. Stovetop: A personal JSONP API for Google Spreadsheets

h2. Tell me more

Stovetop is a Google Appengine appliance you can use to serve you Google
Spreadsheets as JSONP documents.

h2. Installation

NB: I recommend reading this entire document (especially the notes about
security) before proceeding.

To install your own copy of Stovetop follow these steps:

* Setup a new Google Appengine application.
* Install the Google Appengine SDK (wherever you like).
* Copy app.example.yaml to app.yaml.
* Update app.yaml with the application name you registered.
* Copy config.example.py to config.py.
* Update config.py with your application domain, google email, and password.
* Create a new Google Spreadsheet and update config.py with its key.
* Deploy the application to appengine.
* Access http://yourapp.appspot.com/documentname to get your document via JSONP!

h2. Stovetop + Boiler

Stovetop can be combined with "Boiler":http://github.com/bouvard/boiler to
create quasi-realtime spreadsheet-driven widgets for the web.

h2. Notes about security

This application requires you to put your Google Docs username and password into
a plain text document. I recommend the following best practices for securing
your app:

* Create a separate Google account to use only for Stovetop.
* Don't commit your config.py to source control.
* Don't use the --insecure flag with appcfg.py.
